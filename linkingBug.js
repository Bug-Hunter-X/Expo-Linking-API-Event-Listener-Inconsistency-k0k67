This error occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links.  The `Linking.addEventListener` is called, but the event listener never fires, even though the app receives the deep link correctly. This can happen if the app is running in the background, or in the case of iOS when the app was opened via a Universal Link.  The issue is that the Expo Linking API sometimes does not correctly trigger the event listener in these scenarios.
